# Styling the web page

This is the final step of the project, in this step we will be styling the page to make it look like the design image.

## 1: Adding the background image to the header section 
To make the hero section of the page similar to the design, we would have left with adding the background image. We'll make use of the `background-image` property to add the background image to the header section.

You would also additionally add the background color for the main section to keep it gray.



## 2: Setting the background color of the navbar 
Use the color `#212931` and set the opacity to 0.7 to make the navbar translucent. 

You should still keep the first tab of the page highlighted in white background. For now you can add a id attribute to the first header element and set the background color to white. 

## 3: Style the buttons on the page 
All the buttons in the massively page are styled to have a solid border and and white background color. You should implement these styles. 

## 4: Set border for the blog elements
We're almost done with the redesign. The only visible change that is left is to add the thin borders that are visible in the design image. We'll add the border of `1px solid #e6e6e6` to the blog elements. 

We're done with our massively project. The project should now resemble to the design image. If you want to make the page look better, you can optimize the page for mobile devices and change a few elements to your liking.
