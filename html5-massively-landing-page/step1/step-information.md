# Setting up the layout

In the previous step, we have setup the complete HTML Structure to complete the project. In this step, we will focus in completing the layout, so that all the elements of the page are aligned properly. 

## 1: Align header content to center
We'll make use of the `text-content: center` property to align the content of the header to the center.

## 2: Space between containers in the nav bar
We'll make use of the `justify-content: space-between` property to space the containers in the nav bar. Make sure to make the container a flex container to make use of this property

## 3: Adding margin and padding for the header blog 
We'll have to add proper margin and padding so that all the content of the pages are algin properly. We would also want to center the content of the image and the button & make the text alignment justified. 

## 4: Making the blog posts section a grid container 
We'll make use of the `display: grid` property to make the blog posts section a grid container. We'll also make use of the `grid-template-columns` property to make the grid 2 columns wide.

## 5: Make the footer section a grid container.
We'll make use of the same `grid-template-columns` property to align form and the footer components. 

Make sure to add proper padding and margin to the form and the footer elements as needed by referring to the design image.
