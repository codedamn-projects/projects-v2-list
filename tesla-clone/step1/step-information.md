-   **Responsive Design**: Ensure that the menu is fully responsive, adjusting smoothly to various screen sizes and orientations.
-   **Visual Consistency**: Maintain consistency with the overall design theme, keeping in line with the colors, fonts, and styling already established in the landing page.
