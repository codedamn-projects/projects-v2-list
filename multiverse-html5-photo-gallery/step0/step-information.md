# Getting Started

Welcome to the HTML5 Photo Gallery tutorial. In this guided project, we'll create a photo gallery using a set of images that are already provided for you. You'll find these images in the 'assets' folder, and we'll be using the technologies HTML5 and CSS3 to bring this project to life.

For a glimpse of the final design, check out the 'design' folder, which includes screenshots of the completed project for both desktop and mobile views.

Before you dive in, please ensure that you comprehend the following requirements for the project:

1. Construct a gallery using 12 specific images that have been pre-selected for you.
2. Make sure the images adapt to different screen sizes, filling the entire width of the page.
3. Include a footer that mentions the name of the Project.

With the basic requirements clear, you're ready to move on to the next step and begin building your photo gallery!
