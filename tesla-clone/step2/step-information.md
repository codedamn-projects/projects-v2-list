# Items page

In this step, your task is to create the items page, which plays a central role in displaying the various products or features.

Here are the specific requirements for the items page:

-   **Side Bar**: Include a sidebar (see on left on the screenshot) that lists the various items, possibly with a snapshot or brief description.
-   **Snap Count**: Next to each item in the sidebar, display the number of snapshots (or 'snaps') associated with that item.
-   **Clickable Links**: Make each item in the sidebar a clickable link that takes the user directly to the corresponding element on the page.
-   **Consistent Styling**: Ensure that the design of the items page aligns with the overall look and feel of the landing page and mobile menu, maintaining visual coherence across the site.

Here's how it looks:

This page adds depth to your project by providing detailed insights into the various items, so take your time to create a well-structured and engaging layout.

All the best as you dive into this intricate part of your Tesla clone project!
