    Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close
    to the design as possible.

    This project focuses mostly on HTML, CSS and layouts with CSS.

    You can use any tools you like to help you complete this project. So if you've
    got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

    Your users should be able to:
    - View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size.
    - See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.

    Don't forget to share your submissions with the community to get feedback. All
    the best.
